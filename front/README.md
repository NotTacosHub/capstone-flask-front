This is 'Clayton's Blog', a mixmatched web app, with python on the front end because I didn't know if I could do it. These are the URL controls: 
url/admin/post/create to create a new post
url/admin/post/list to edit/delete a post

front-end url: clayton-smith-frontend.herokuapp.com
back-end url: clayton-smith-capstone-project.herokuapp.com

front-end Github url: https://github.com/NotTacosHub/capstone-flask-front
back-end Github url: https://github.com/NotTacosHub/capstone-flask-back

There were a lot of new things I used, but the biggest was the template language, 'Jinja2'
